I was invited to Swiftspend Finance, a leading fintech company, to enhance their cybersecurity. My task was to investigate incidents using Wazuh and Sysmon to identify suspicious activity in the logs and develop recommendations for improving security. The analysis covered events on April 29, 2024, from 12:00 to 20:00. I accessed the Wazuh Dashboard, set time filters, and used the saved query Monday_Monitor to search for anomalies. During the investigation, I identified a downloaded file, SwiftSpend_Financial_Expenses.xlsm, which served as the attacker's entry point. I discovered the creation of a scheduled task using a command that modified the registry and executed a hidden PowerShell script. The task was set to run at 12:34. The logs contained an encoded string, cGluZyB3d3cueW91YXJldnVsbmVyYWJsZS50aG0=, which, when decoded using CyberChef, revealed the command ping www.youarevulnerable.thm, indicating a connection test to the attacker's server. I also found the creation of a new user account with the password I_AM_M0NIT0R1NG and the execution of memotech.exe, used for credential dumping. The analysis showed that data was exfiltrated from the host, including the flag THM{M0N1T0R_1$_1N_3FF3CT}, confirming a successful cyberattack. As a result, I developed several recommendations: restricting the download of executable files from untrusted sources, monitoring scheduled tasks, strengthening account security, preventing the execution of credential-dumping tools, and blocking suspicious network connections. This analysis not only helped identify the threat but also provided effective measures to enhance Swiftspend Financeâ€™s cybersecurity.
